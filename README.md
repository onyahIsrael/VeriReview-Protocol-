# VeriReview-Protocol-
The Trust Layer for African Commerce
VeriReview is a decentralized protocol built on Avalanche 9000. It is designed to solve the chronic trust deficit in the Nigerian e commerce market. Our platform ensures that every product review is cryptographically linked to a verified purchase, ending the era of deceptive marketing and counterfeit listings.

The Problem
The Nigerian digital economy is currently hindered by the viral What I Ordered vs What I Got crisis. With over 33 billion dollars in projected transaction volume by 2026, the lack of verifiable trust signals remains the biggest barrier to growth.

Fake Social Proof: 90 percent of reviews on social platforms are fabricated by sellers.

High Rejection Rates: Lack of trust forces a reliance on Cash on Delivery, leading to 20 percent order rejection rates for honest vendors.

Siloed Reputation: Good vendors cannot port their hard earned reputation across different marketplaces.

The Solution
VeriReview transforms trust into a portable digital asset. We use the speed and scalability of Avalanche 9000 to issue Proof of Purchase Attestations.

Verified Reviews: Only users with a confirmed on chain payment hash can submit a rating.

Immutable Transparency: Reviews are stored on the Avalanche C Chain and cannot be deleted or manipulated by vendors.

Portable Reputation: Users and vendors carry their VeriReview score across any application in the Avalanche ecosystem.

Sophisticated Tech Stack
Our architecture utilizes the latest advancements in the Avalanche 2026 roadmap.

Avalanche 9000 L1: We leverage the Etna upgrade and ACP 77 to maintain a high performance, low cost environment for retail data.

Interchain Messaging (ICM): We use ICM to broadcast trust signals across different Avalanche L1s. This allows a game or a marketplace on a separate subnet to verify a user’s shopping history instantly.

Account Abstraction: We implement ERC 4337 to provide a gasless experience. Nigerian shoppers use their biometric data to sign reviews without ever seeing a private key.

Payment Oracle: A secure bridge to Paystack and Flutterwave ensures that the protocol only unlocks review capabilities after a successful Naira transaction.
